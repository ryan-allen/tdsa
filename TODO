[ ] jobs on fsw are transient, so need a way to capture live links and test them?

      get '/', :follow => '/jobs/(\d+)' do |job_id| do
        # ...
      end
      
    yeah fucking awesome! do that!

[ ] separate out asserts and curl and dsl scoping into separate files, good style that!

[ ] how can we test this? (we're prototyping!... hehe - oh, mock out the curl bit after we
    finish the first todo)
