[ ] jobs on fsw are transient, so need a way to capture live links and test them?

      get '/', :follow => '/jobs/(\d+)' do |job_id| do
        # ...
      end
      
    yeah fucking awesome! do that!

[x] separate out asserts and curl and dsl scoping into separate files, good style that!
[ ] re: last point - the separation of concerns is fucked, while the methods are all in
    kind of related files they're all using @failures and @status and all that junk...
    how should i arrange them?

[ ] how can we test this? (we're prototyping!... hehe - oh, mock out the curl bit after we
    finish the second todo)
    
[ ] assert_redirected_to

[ ] write a readme for teh people

[ ] prepare the gem (generate the gem with hoe, then move all this junk)

[ ] publish to gems.yeahnah.org, or gems.eden.cc or something!

[ ] the first point, :follow should be able to do something like :first, :last, :random, 
    :number => 5...... :follow_any? :follow_first, :follow_random? will i need hpricot 
    for this?
