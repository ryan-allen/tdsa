[ ] jobs on fsw are transient, so need a way to capture live links and test them?

      get '/', :follow => '/jobs/(\d+)' do |job_id| do
        # ...
      end
      
    yeah fucking awesome! do that!

[x] separate out asserts and curl and dsl scoping into separate files, good style that!
[ ] not sure if the separation is good - too much cross cutting concerns? how else can i
    arrange it?

[ ] how can we test this? (we're prototyping!... hehe - oh, mock out the curl bit after we
    finish the first todo)
    
[ ] remember assert_redirected_to

[ ] write a readme

[ ] prepare the gem (generate the gem with hoe, then move all this across)

[ ] publish!

[ ] the first point, :follow should be able to do something like :first, :last, :random, :number => 5...... :follow_any? :follow_first, :follow_random? will i need hpricot for this?
