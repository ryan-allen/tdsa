[TDSA - Test Driven System Administration]

  Author: Ryan Allen (ryan@yeahnah.org)

  This is by no means a full featured sysadmin testing tool, but 
  it fulfils one of our needs: custom configuration of lighttpd.

  If you've ever done any work with mod-rewrite or mod-redirect
  you know how bloody annoying it can be to get working, and then
  how much more annoying it can be when you make changes that break
  other things. We had exactly that problem.

  We practice test driven development when we're coding, why can't
  we do this with our web servers? I say we can!

  To run the example test, go:

    ruby example.rb
  
  For API examples (they're actually our real world tests), see example.rb.

  A bit to do still, but quite nice and useful so far! See TODO for 
  my rambling notes (they mean something to me, at least). In 
  particular two features we're going to implement next are:

    * assert_redirected_to for testing mod-rediect (i.e. checking 
      the Location: header, though we can do this with assert_header)
    * a fancy :follow => /regex-of-link/ for testing dynamic links, 
      i.e. on our job board, we want to make sure that /jobs/120 works, 
      but the jobs are transient - so we probably should select a link
      dynamically
